        Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

        ** Experimental Feature **

        Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent

        removed from future releases if the problems cannot be

        ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

        The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
        custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility

          <!-- Query Related Event Listeners

          Various IndexSearcher related events can trigger Listeners to
          take actions.

          newSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being prepared
          and there is a current searcher handling requests (aka
          registered).  It can be used to prime certain caches to
          prevent long request times for certain requests.

          firstSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being
          prepared but there is no current registered searcher to handle
          requests or to gain autowarming data from.

        <!-- Request Dispatcher

        This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
        should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

          <!-- Request Parsing

          These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
          what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
          those requests

          enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
          and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

          multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
          Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

          formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
          form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
          POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
          fitting into the URL.

          addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
          the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
          object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the
          key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
          Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom
          plugins.

          *** WARNING ***
          Before enabling remote streaming, you should make sure your
          system has authentication enabled.

          <requestParsers enableRemoteStreaming="false"
            multipartUploadLimitInKB="-1"

          <!-- HTTP Caching

          Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

          The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
          related headers
          -->
          <httpCaching never304="true" />
          <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
            generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
            if the value contains "max-age=")

            By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.

            You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
              never304="true"
              -->
              <!--
              <httpCaching never304="true" >

              <!-- To enable Solr to respond with automatically generated HTTP
              Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
              correctly, set the value of never304="false"

              This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
              headers based on the properties of the Index.

              The following options can also be specified to affect the
              values of these headers...

              lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
              Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
              requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
              was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
              you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
              index was last modified.

              etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
              header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
              different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
              significant changes to your config file)

              (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
              the never304="true" option)
              -->

            Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
            based on the path specified in the request.

            not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

            <!-- Search Components

            Search components are registered to SolrCore and used by
            instances of SearchHandler (which can access them by name)

            By default, the following components are available:

            <searchComponent name="query"     class="solr.QueryComponent" />
            <searchComponent name="facet"     class="solr.FacetComponent" />
            <searchComponent name="mlt"       class="solr.MoreLikeThisComponent" />
            <searchComponent name="highlight" class="solr.HighlightComponent" />
            <searchComponent name="stats"     class="solr.StatsComponent" />
            <searchComponent name="debug"     class="solr.DebugComponent" />

            Default configuration in a requestHandler would look like:

            <arr name="components">
              <str>query</str>
              <str>facet</str>
              <str>mlt</str>
              <str>highlight</str>
              <str>stats</str>
              <str>debug</str>
            </arr>

            If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names,
            that will be used instead of the default.

            To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:

            <arr name="first-components">
              <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
            </arr>

            <arr name="last-components">
              <str>myLastComponentName</str>
            </arr>

            NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
            always be executed after the "last-components"

                              <transformer name="mytrans3" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.ValueAugmenterFactory" >
                                <double name="defaultValue">5</double>
                              </transformer>

                              If you are using the QueryElevationComponent, you may wish to mark documents that get boosted.  The
                              EditorialMarkerFactory will do exactly that:
                              <transformer name="qecBooster" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.EditorialMarkerFactory" />
                              -->
                            </config>
