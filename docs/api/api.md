# The DocumentCloud API

All APIs besides the authentication endpoints are served from
<https://api.www.documentcloud.org/api>.

## Overview

The API end points are generally organized as `/api/<resource>/` representing
the entirety of the resource, and `/api/<resource>/<id>/` representing a single
resource identified by its ID. All REST actions are not available on every
endpoint, and some resources may have additional endpoints, but the following
are how HTTP verbs generally map to REST operations:

`/api/<resource>/`

| HTTP Verb | REST Operation        | Parameters                                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET       | List the resources    | May support parameters for filtering                                         |
| POST      | Create a new resource | Must supply all `required` fields, and may supply all non-`read only` fields |

`/api/<resource>/<id>/`

| HTTP Verb | REST Operation                | Parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET       | Display the resource          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| PUT       | Update the resource           | Same as for creating - all required fields must be present. For updating resources `PATCH` is usually preferred, as it allows you to only update the fields needed. `PUT` support is included for completeness |
| PATCH     | Partially update the resource | Same as for creating, but all fields are optional                                                                                                                                                              |
| DELETE    | Destroy the resources         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A select few of the resources support some bulk operations on the `/api/<resource>/` route:

| HTTP Verb | REST Operation      | Parameters                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST      | Bulk create         | A list of objects, where each object is what you would `POST` for a single object                                             |
| PUT       | Bulk update         | A list of objects, where each object is what you would `PUT` for a single object &mdash; except it must also include the ID   |
| PATCH     | Bulk partial update | A list of objects, where each object is what you would `PATCH` for a single object &mdash; except it must also include the ID |
| DELETE    | Bulk destroy        | Bulk destroys will have a filtering parameter, often required, to specify which resources to delete                           |

### Responses

Lists response will be of the form

```
{
    "count": <count>,
    "next": <next url if applicable>,
    "previous": <previous url if applicable>,
    "results": <list of results>
}
```

with a 200 status code.

Getting a single resource, creating and updating will return just the object.
Create uses a 201 status code and get and update will return 200.

Delete will have an empty response with a 204 status code.

Batch updates will contain a list of objects updated with a 200 status code.

Specifying invalid parameters will generally return a 400 error code with a
JSON object with a single `"error"` key, whose value will be an error message.
Specifying an ID that does not exist or that you do not have access to view
will return status 404. Trying to create or update a resource you do not have
permission to will return status 403.

### Pagination

All list views accept a `per_page` parameter, which specifies how many
resources to list per page. It is `25` by default and may be set up to `100`
for authenticated users. For anonymous users it is restricted to `25`. You
may register for a free account at <https://accounts.muckrock.com/> to use the
`100` limit. You may view subsequent pages by using the `next` URL, or by
specifying a `page` parameter directly.

#### Cursor Based Pagination

Page offset pagination does not scale well to a large number of pages.  For
improved performance, DocumentCloud will be switching to a cursor based
pagination system.  Instead of a `page` parameter, there is a `cursor`
parameter, which accepts an opaque `cursor` which specifies the last value
seen.  To use this system, you must use the `next` and `previous` links as
returned by the API, as random access is not available.  This system also
restricts arbitrary ordering of the results, accept for the document search
route, which will still allow re-ordering with cursor based pagination.  The
`per_page` parameter will also continue to work.  To opt in to this system now
and get increased performance, add the query parameter `version=2.0` to all of
your API queries.  The latest version of the python library is already using
this version.  In the future, the default version will be switched to cursor
pagination, and some time after that page offset based pagination will be
disabled completely.  If you do not set the page parameter manually, it is
likely you will not have to make any changes to your scripts.  If you do set
the `page` parameter, you will need to switch to using the `next` and
`previous` links.

### Sub Resources

Some resources also support sub resources, which is a resource that belongs to another. The general format is:

`/api/<resource>/<id>/<subresource>/`

or

`/api/<resource>/<id>/<subresource>/<subresource_id>/`

It generally works the same as a resource, except scoped to the parent resource.

TODO: Examples

### Filters

Filters on list views which have choices generally allow you to specify
multiple values, and will filter on all resources that match at least one
choices. To specify multiple parameters you may either supply a comma
separated list of IDs &mdash; `?parameter=1,2` &mdash; or by specify the
parameter multiple times &mdash; `?parameter=1&parameter=2`.

### Rate Limits

The DocumentCloud API is rate limited to 10 requests per second.  It also
allows bursts up to 20 requests.  This means if you exceed the the 10 request
per second limit, it will serve you up to 20 requests more quickly, while
keeping track of your average rate.  After the 20 requests are served,
additional requests will be rejected with an HTTP status of 503 until you again
fall under an average of 10 requests per second.  If you use the Python
DocumentCloud library, it will automatically throttle your requests to 10 per
second to avoid going over the rate limit.  If you are writing custom code,
please be mindful of the rate limits.

There is also a secondary limit of 500 requests per day for anonymous users.
If you exceed this limit, you will start receiving errors with an HTTP status
of 429.  In order to avoid this, please register for a free account at
<https://aacounts.muckrock.com/>.  Currently, there are no daily limits of
registered accounts, although this may change in the future.

## Authentication

Authentication happens at the MuckRock accounts server located at
<https://accounts.muckrock.com/>. The API provided there will supply you with
a [JWT][1] access token and refresh token in exchange for your username and
password. The access token should be placed in the `Authorization` header
preceded by `Bearer` - `{'Authorization': 'Bearer <access token>'}`. The
access token is valid for 5 minutes, after which you will receive a 403
forbidden error if you continue trying to use it. At this point you may use
the refresh token to obtain a new access token and refresh token. The refresh
token is valid for one day.

### POST /api/token/

| Param    | Type   | Description   |
| -------- | ------ | ------------- |
| username | String | Your username |
| password | String | Your password |

#### Response

    {'access': <access token>, 'refresh': <refresh token>}

### POST /api/refresh/

| Param   | Type   | Description   |
| ------- | ------ | ------------- |
| refresh | String | Refresh token |

#### Response

    {'access': <access token>, 'refresh': <refresh token>}

## Documents

The documents API allows you to upload, browse and edit documents. To add or
remove documents from a project, please see [project
documents](#project-documents).

### Uploading a Document

There are two supported ways to upload documents &mdash; directly uploading the
file to our storage servers or by providing a URL to a publicly available
PDF or other [supported file type](#supported-file-types).

#### Direct File Upload Flow

1. `POST /api/documents/` <br><br>
   To initiate an upload, you will first create the document. You may specify all
   writable document fields (besides `file_url`). The response will contain all
   the fields for the document, with two being of note for this flow:
   `presigned_url` and `id`. <br><br>
   If you would like to upload files in bulk, you may `POST` a list of JSON
   objects to `/api/documents/` instead of a single object. The response will
   contain a list of document objects.

2. `PUT <presigned_url>` <br><br>
   Next, you will `PUT` the binary data for the file to the given
   `presigned_url`. The presigned URL is valid for 5 minutes. You may obtain a
   new URL by issuing a `GET` request to `/api/documents/\<id\>/`. <br><br>
   If you are bulk uploading, you will still need to issue a single `PUT` to the
   corresponding `presigned_url` for each file.

3. `POST /api/documents/<id>/process/` <br><br>
   Finally, you will begin processing of the document. Note that this endpoint
   accepts only one optional parameter &mdash; `force_ocr` which, if set to true,
   will OCR the document even if it contains embedded text. <br><br>
   If you are uploading in bulk you can issue a single `POST` to
   `/api/document/process/` which will begin processing in bulk. You should pass
   a list of objects containing the document IDs of the documents you would like
   to being processing. You may optionally specify `force_ocr` for each document.

#### URL Upload Flow

1. `POST /api/documents/`

If you set `file_url` to a URL pointing to a publicly accessible PDF, our
servers will fetch the PDF and begin processing it automatically.

You may also send a list of document objects with `file_url` set to bulk upload
files using this flow.

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/documents/` &mdash; List documents
- `POST /api/documents/` &mdash; Create document
- `PUT /api/documents/` &mdash; Bulk update documents
- `PATCH /api/documents/` &mdash; Bulk partial update documents
- `DELETE /api/documents/` &mdash; Bulk delete documents
  - Bulk delete will not allow you to indiscriminately delete all of your
    documents. You must specify which document IDs you want to delete using
    the `id__in` filter.
- `POST /api/documents/process/` &mdash; Bulk process documents
  - This will allow you to process multiple documents with a single API call.
    Expect parameters: `[{"id": 1, "force_ocr": true}, {"id": 2}]`
    It expects a list of objects, where each object contains the ID of the
    document to process, and an optional boolean, `force_ocr`, which will OCR
    the document even if it contains embedded text if set to `true`
- `GET /api/documents/search/` &mdash; [Search][6] documents
- `GET /api/documents/<id>/` &mdash; Get document
- `PUT /api/documents/<id>/` &mdash; Update document
- `PATCH /api/documents/<id>/` &mdash; Partial update document
- `DELETE /api/documents/<id>/` &mdash; Delete document
- `POST /api/documents/<id>/process/` &mdash; Process document
  - This will process a document. It is used after uploading the file in the
    [direct file upload flow](#direct-file-upload-flow) or to reprocess a
    document, which you may want to do in the case of an error. It accepts
    one optional boolean parameter, `force_ocr`, which will OCR the document
    even if it contains embedded text if it is set to `true`. Note that it
    is an error to try to process a document that is already processing.
- `DELETE /api/documents/<id>/process/` &mdash; Cancel processing document
  - This will cancel the processing of a document. Note that it is an error
    to try to cancel the processing if the document is not processing.
- `GET /api/documents/<id>/search/` &mdash; [Search][6] within a document

### Filters

- `ordering` &mdash; Sort the results &mdash; valid options include: `created_at`,
  `page_count`, `title`, and `source`. You may prefix any valid option with
  `-` to sort it in reverse order.
- `user` &mdash; Filter by the ID of the owner of the document.
- `organization` &mdash; Filter by the ID of the organization of the document.
- `project` &mdash; Filter by the ID of a project the document is in.
- `access` &mdash; Filter by the [access level](#access-levels).
- `status` &mdash; Filter by [status](#statuses).
- `created_at__lt`, `created_at__gt` &mdash; Filter by documents created
  either before or after a given date. You may specify both to find documents
  created between two dates. This may be a date or date time, in the following
  formats: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD+HH:MM:SS`.
- `page_count`, `page_count__lt`, `page_count__gt` &mdash; Filter by documents
  with a specified number of pages, or more or less pages then a given amount.
- `id__in` &mdash; Filter by specific document IDs, passed in as comma
  separated values.

### Notes

Notes can be left on documents for yourself, or to be shared with other users. They may contain HTML for formatting.

### Errors

Sometimes errors happen &mdash; if you find one of your documents in an error
state, you may check the errors here to see a log of the latest, as well as
all previous errors. If the message is cryptic, please contact us &mdash; we
are happy to help figure out what went wrong.

#### Fields

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/documents/<document_id>/errors/` - List errors

### Data

Documents may contain user supplied metadata. You may assign multiple values
to arbitrary keys. This is represented as a JSON object, where each key has a
list of strings as a value. The special key `_tag` is used by the front end to
represent tags. These values are useful for searching and organizing documents.
You may directly set or update the data from the document endpoints, but these
additional endpoints are supplied to add or remove data on a per key basis.

#### Fields

| Field  | Type        | Options      | Description                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| values | List:String | Required     | The values associated with a key |
| remove | List:String | Not Required | Values to be removed             |

`remove` is only used for `PATCH`ing. `values` is not required when `PATCH`ing.

#### Endpoints

- `GET /api/documents/<document_id>/data/` - List values for all keys
  - The response for this is a JSON object with a property for each key,
    which will always be a list of strings, corresponding to the values
    associated with that key. Example:
    ```
    {
      "_tag": ["important"],
      "location": ["boston", "new york"]
    }
    ```
- `GET /api/documents/<document_id>/data/<key>/` - Get values for the given key
  - The response for this is a JSON list of strings. Example: `["one", "two"]`
- `PUT /api/documents/<document_id>/data/<key>/` - Set values for the given key
  - This will override all values currently under key
- `PATCH /api/documents/<document_id>/data/<key>/` - Add and/or remove values for the given key
- `DELETE /api/documents/<document_id>/data/<key>/` - Delete all values for a given key

### Redactions

Redactions allow you to obscure parts of the document which are confidential
before publishing them. The pages which are redacted will be fully flattened
and reprocessed, so that the original content is not present in lower levels of
the image or as text data. Redactions are not reversible, and may only be
created, not retrieved or edited.

#### Fields

| Field       | Type    | Options  | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| page_number | Integer | Required | The page of the document this redaction appears on                    |
| x1          | Float   | Required | Left most coordinate of the redaction, as a percentage of page size   |
| x2          | Float   | Required | Right most coordinate of the redaction, as a percentage of page size  |
| y1          | Float   | Required | Top most coordinate of the redaction, as a percentage of page size    |
| y2          | Float   | Required | Bottom most coordinate of the redaction, as a percentage of page size |

#### Endpoints

- `POST /api/documents/<document_id>/redactions/` - Create redaction

### Modifications

Modifications allow you to perform page modification operations on a document, including moving pages, rotating pages, copying pages, deleting pages, and inserting pages from other documents. Applying modifications effectively shuffles, removes, and copies pages, preserving and duplicating page information as needed (this includes page text and any annotations and sections attached to the page). No page text needs to be reprocessed or re-OCR'd. After successfully applying modifications, the document cannot be reverted.

#### Modification Specification

To support a flexible host of potential modifications, you must pass in the modifications as a JSON array that lists the operations to take place. The modification specification defines the pages that should compose the document post-modification and any operations such as rotation to apply to the pages. Each element of the modification array can have the following fields (instructive examples will be listed after the official specification):

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| page          | A comma-separated string of page ranges, which can include individual pages or hyphenated inclusive runs of pages. Page numbers are 0-based (the first page of the document is page `0`, and `0-9` refers to the first through the 10th page of the document). Valid examples of page ranges include `"7"`, `"0-499"`, `"0-5,8,11-13"`, and `0,0,0` (page numbers can be repeated to duplicate them). |
| id            | If unspecified, pull pages from the current document. Otherwise, pull pages from the document with the specified id.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| modifications | An array of JSON objects defining modifications to take place. The only currently defined page modification operation is `rotate`, which rotates pages clockwise, counterclockwise, or halfway. Rotation is specified as `{"type": "rotate", "angle": <angle>}`, where `<angle>` is one of `cc`, `ccw`, or `hw` (corresponding to clockwise, counterclockwise, and halfway, respectively).            |

#### Example Specifications

The following examples assume you are modifying the Mueller Report, a 448-page document.

| Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                            |

## Projects

Projects are collections of documents. They can be used for organizing groups
of documents, or for collaborating with other users by sharing access to
private documents.

### Sharing Documents

Projects may be used for sharing documents. When you add a collaborator to a
project, you may select one of three access levels:

- `view` - This gives the collaborator permission to view your documents that
  you have added to the project
- `edit` - This gives the collaborator permission to view or edit your
  documents you have added to the project
- `admin` - This gives the collaborator both view and edit permissions, as well
  as the ability to add their own documents and invite other collaborators to
  the project

Additionally, you may add public documents to a project, for organizational
purposes. Obviously, no permissions are granted to your or your collaborators
when you add documents you do not own to your project &mdash; this is tracked
by the `edit_access` field on the [project membership](#project-documents).
When you add documents you or your organization do own, it will be added with
`edit_access` enabled by default. You may override this using the API if you
would like to add your documents to a project, but not extend permissions to
any of your collaborators. Also note that documents shared with you for
editing via another project may not be added to your own project with
`edit_access` enabled. This means the original owner of a document may revoke
any access they have granted to others via projects at any time.

- `DELETE /api/projects/<project_id>/documents/` - Bulk remove documents from
  the project
  - You should specify which document IDs you want to delete using the
    `document_id__in` filter. This endpoint _will_ allow you to remove all

- `public` &ndash; Anyone on the internet can search for and view the document
- `private` &ndash; Only people with explicit permission (via collaboration) have access
- `organization` &ndash; Only the people in your organization have access

For notes, the `organization` access level will extend access to all users with
edit access to the document &mdash; this includes [project](#projects)
collaborators.

### Statuses

The status informs you to the current status of your document.

- `success` &ndash; The document has been succesfully processed
- `readable` &ndash; The document is currently processing, but is readable during the operation
- `pending` &ndash; The document is processing and not currently readable

### Page Spec

The page spec is a compressed string that lists dimensions in pixels for every
page in a document. Refer to [ListCrunch][2] for the compression format. For
example, `612.0x792.0:0-447`

### Static Assets

The static assets for a document are loaded from different URLs depending on
its [access level](#access-levels). Append the following to the `asset_url`
returned to load the static asset:

| Asset      | Path                                                          | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document   | documents/\<id\>/\<slug\>.pdf                                 | The original document                                           |
| Full Text  | documents/\<id\>/\<slug\>.txt                                 | The full text of the document, obtained from the PDF or via OCR |
| JSON Text  | documents/\<id\>/\<slug\>.txt.json                            | The text of the document, in a custom JSON format (see below)   |
| Page Text  | documents/\<id\>/pages/\<slug\>-p\<page number\>.txt          | The text for each page in the document                          |
| Page Image | documents/\<id\>/pages/\<slug\>-p\<page number\>-\<size\>.gif | An image of each page in the document, in various sizes         |

\<size\> may be one of `large`, `normal`, `small`, or `thumbnail`

#### TXT JSON Format

The TXT JSON file is a single file containing all of the text, but broken out
per page. This is useful if you need the text per page for every page, as you
can download just a single file. There is a top level object with an `updated`
key, which is a Unix time stamp of when the file was last updated. There may
be an `is_import` key, which will be set to `true` if this document was
imported from legacy DocumentCloud. The last key is `pages` which contains the
per page info. It is a list of objects, one per page. Each page object will
have a `page` key, which is a 0-indexed page number. There is a `contents` key
which contains the text for the page. There is an `ocr` key, which is the
version of OCR software used to obtain the text. Finally there is an `updated`
key, which is a Unix time stamp of when this page was last updated.

### Expandable Fields

The API uses expandable fields in a few places, which are implemented by the
[Django REST - FlexFields][5] package. It allows related fields, which would
normally be returned by ID, be expanded into the fully nested representation.
This allows you to save additional requests to the server when you need the
related information, but for the server to not need to serve this information
when it is not needed.

To expand one of the expandable fields, which are document in the fields
section for each resource, add the `expand` query parameter to your request:

`?expand=user`

To expand multiple fields, separate them with a comma:

`?expand=user,organization`

You may also expand nested fields if the expanded field has its own expandable
fields:

`?expand=user.organization`

To expand all fields:

`?expand=~all`
